# Enhanced Subscription Cancellation System

## Overview

The subscription cancellation system now includes automatic note management when users downgrade from Pro/Student plans to the Free plan. This ensures compliance with Free plan limitations while providing clear warnings to users.

## Key Features

### 1. **Immediate Plan Downgrade**
- When users cancel their subscription, they are immediately switched to the Free plan
- No grace period - cancellation is effective immediately
- Stripe subscription is cancelled completely (not at period end)

### 2. **Intelligent Note Management**
- **Free Plan Limit**: 3 notes maximum
- **Automatic Deletion**: If user has >3 notes, excess notes are automatically deleted
- **Preservation Logic**: Keeps the 3 **oldest** notes (by creation date)
- **Deletion Logic**: Deletes the **newest** notes first

### 3. **Enhanced Warning Modal**
- **Real-time Note Count**: Fetches current note count before showing modal
- **Deletion Preview**: Shows exactly how many notes will be deleted
- **Visual Warnings**: Color-coded alerts for different scenarios
- **Detailed Information**: Explains the process step-by-step

### 4. **Cross-Table Note Management**
- Handles notes from all tables: `text_notes`, `file_notes`, `video_notes`
- Batch deletion for performance
- Atomic operations to prevent data corruption

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: User with ‚â§3 notes
1. User clicks "Cancel Subscription" on Free plan card
2. System fetches note count 
3. Modal shows "Notes Safe" message in green
4. User confirms cancellation
5. Subscription cancelled, no notes deleted

### Scenario 2: User with >3 notes
1. User clicks "Cancel Subscription" on Free plan card
2. System fetches note count (e.g., 8 notes)
3. Modal shows:
   - Current note count: 8 notes
   - Warning: 5 notes will be deleted
   - Which notes are kept: 3 oldest notes
   - Confirmation button: "Yes, Delete 5 Notes"
4. User confirms cancellation
5. Subscription cancelled, 5 newest notes deleted automatically

## API Implementation

### `/api/stripe/cancel-subscription`

**Enhanced functionality:**
- Counts notes across all tables
- Sorts notes by creation date (oldest first)
- Deletes excess notes in batches by type
- Updates subscription to 'free' plan
- Returns deletion statistics

**Response includes:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Subscription cancelled and downgraded to free plan successfully",
  "subscription": {
    "id": "sub_xxx",
    "status": "canceled",
    "newPlan": "free"
  },
  "notesDeleted": {
    "text": 2,
    "file": 1,
    "video": 2,
    "total": 5
  },
  "remainingNotes": 3
}
```

## Frontend Implementation

### Enhanced Pricing Page Modal

**New State Variables:**
- `userNotesCount`: Current note count
- `loadingNotesCount`: Loading state for note fetching

**Modal Features:**
- **Loading State**: Shows spinner while fetching notes
- **Notes Summary**: Displays current note count with üìä icon
- **Deletion Warning**: Red alert box with üóëÔ∏è icon when notes will be deleted
- **Safe Confirmation**: Green confirmation when no deletion needed
- **Dynamic Button Text**: Changes based on deletion scenario
- **Detailed Process**: Lists all steps that will happen

**Visual Elements:**
- Color-coded status boxes (blue for info, red for warnings, green for safe)
- Icons for visual clarity
- Loading spinners during operations
- Disabled states during processing

## Database Operations

### Note Counting Query
```sql
-- Counts across all note tables
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM text_notes WHERE user_id = ?
UNION ALL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM file_notes WHERE user_id = ?
UNION ALL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM video_notes WHERE user_id = ?
```

### Note Deletion Logic
1. **Fetch all notes** sorted by `created_at ASC` (oldest first)
2. **Keep first 3** (oldest notes)
3. **Delete the rest** in batches by table type
4. **Log statistics** for user feedback

### Deletion Queries
```sql
-- Delete excess text notes
DELETE FROM text_notes 
WHERE id IN (list_of_ids_to_delete)

-- Delete excess file notes  
DELETE FROM file_notes 
WHERE id IN (list_of_ids_to_delete)

-- Delete excess video notes
DELETE FROM video_notes 
WHERE id IN (list_of_ids_to_delete)
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- If note deletion fails, cancellation still proceeds
- Detailed error logging for debugging
- User receives successful cancellation message
- Admin can manually clean up notes if needed

### User Feedback
- Loading states during all operations
- Clear success/error messages
- Detailed deletion statistics
- Fallback to generic messages if API fails

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Uses user's authenticated token for all operations
- Verifies subscription ownership before cancellation
- Row Level Security ensures users can only delete own notes

### Data Protection
- Only deletes user's own notes (RLS enforced)
- Atomic operations prevent partial deletions
- Logs all operations for audit trail

## Deployment Notes

### Database Requirements
- All note tables must exist: `text_notes`, `file_notes`, `video_notes`
- Proper RLS policies must be in place
- Indexes on `user_id` and `created_at` for performance

### Environment Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Stripe environment variables for cancellation

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Note Archive**: Instead of deletion, archive notes for later recovery
2. **User Choice**: Let users select which notes to keep
3. **Bulk Export**: Allow downloading notes before deletion
4. **Undo Period**: Temporary recovery window after cancellation
5. **Email Notification**: Send summary of cancelled subscription and deleted notes

### Analytics
- Track cancellation reasons
- Monitor deletion patterns
- Measure user retention after cancellation warnings

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **No Notes**: User with 0 notes cancels subscription
2. **Within Limit**: User with 1-3 notes cancels subscription  
3. **Over Limit**: User with 4+ notes cancels subscription
4. **Mixed Note Types**: User with notes across all tables
5. **API Failures**: Test graceful handling of deletion failures
6. **Network Issues**: Test modal behavior during slow connections

### Manual Testing
- Create test accounts with different note counts
- Test cancellation flow for each scenario
- Verify correct notes are kept/deleted
- Confirm subscription status updates correctly

## Support Documentation

### User Guide Points
- Explain Free plan limitations clearly
- Document which notes are kept (oldest 3)
- Provide data export instructions before cancellation
- Clarify that cancellation is immediate (no grace period)

This enhanced cancellation system provides a transparent, user-friendly way to handle plan downgrades while maintaining data integrity and compliance with plan limitations.
