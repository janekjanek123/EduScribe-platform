# EduScribe Fix Summary

This document outlines all the fixes made to the EduScribe application to resolve various issues.

## 1. Database Schema Issues

### Problem
The application had issues with database column casing. The code was using lowercase column names (e.g., `createdat`) while the database schema expected camelCase column names with quotes (e.g., `"createdAt"`). This mismatch caused errors like "Could not find the 'createdAt' column of 'youtube_notes' in the schema cache".

### Solution
1. Created a SQL script (`fix-youtube-notes-schema.sql`) to fix the table schema with consistent camelCase naming
2. Updated API code to use proper camelCase column names with quotes
3. Added diagnostics tools to check schema and refresh the cache
4. Added convenience scripts in package.json for schema maintenance
5. Created an API endpoint (`/api/init-db`) to apply schema fixes programmatically

### Usage
To fix schema issues:
```bash
# Check current schema status
npm run check-schema

# Apply schema fix via SQL
npm run fix-schema 

# Or via API endpoint
npm run init-db
```

## 2. API Route Duplication Issues

### Problem
The application had duplicate API routes causing conflicts. NextJS was detecting duplicate routes in both `/pages/api` and `/src/app/api` directories:
```
Duplicate page detected. pages/api/youtube-notes.ts and src/app/api/youtube-notes/route.ts resolve to /api/youtube-notes
```

### Solution
1. Removed the empty `pages` and `src/pages` directories
2. Updated `next.config.js` to remove the experimental `appDir` setting
3. Fixed API routes to ensure they are only defined in one location (App Router)

## 3. YouTube Transcript Integration

### Problem
The transcript API route had issues with the YouTube transcript library integration.

### Solution
1. Fixed the API route to properly use the project's existing subtitle extraction service
2. Added proper error handling for yt-dlp requirements
3. Integrated with the application's existing YouTube services for consistent behavior

## 4. Environment Issues

### Problem
Some dependencies were missing and there were syntax issues in various files.

### Solution
1. Added missing dependencies (dotenv)
2. Fixed syntax errors and mismatched braces
3. Removed stray characters from the end of files
4. Created proper error handling for environment-specific issues

## 5. Configuration Updates

### Problem
The `next.config.js` file had outdated configuration settings.

### Solution
1. Removed deprecated `experimental.appDir` setting that was causing warnings
2. Updated page extensions to include all necessary file types
3. Configured proper API route handling via rewrites

## How to Verify Fixes

1. Start the application with `npm run dev`
2. Check for any console errors related to duplicate pages or schema issues
3. Test the YouTube note-taking functionality
4. Verify transcript extraction is working properly
5. Check database operations through the application UI
