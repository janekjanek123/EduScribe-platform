# EduScribe: Supabase Schema Fix

## Quick Start

Run these commands to fix the Supabase schema issues:

```bash
# Check current schema issues
npm run check-schema

# Apply the SQL fix (requires Supabase CLI)
npm run fix-schema

# Refresh the schema cache
npm run refresh-schema
```

## The Problem

The application was encountering errors when storing YouTube notes in the database:

- Error message: `Could not find the 'createdAt' column of 'youtube_notes' in the schema cache`
- Symptoms: Notes not being saved, 500 errors from API, empty content in the frontend

This was caused by a mismatch between the column names in the code (`createdat`, lowercase) and the expected column names in the schema (`"createdAt"`, camelCase with quotes).

## What Has Been Fixed

1. **SQL Fix Script**: Created a script to rebuild the `youtube_notes` table with the correct schema

2. **API Code Updates**: Modified the code to use the correct camelCase column names

3. **Better Error Handling**: Added more detailed error logging to help diagnose future issues

4. **Diagnostic Tools**: Added tools to check and refresh the schema

## How It Works

PostgreSQL has specific rules about column names:

- **Unquoted names** (like `createdat`) are automatically converted to lowercase
- **Quoted names** (like `"createdAt"`) preserve their case
- When our code used lowercase names but the schema expected camelCase, it caused errors

Our fix ensures both the schema and the code use consistent camelCase naming with quotes.

## If You Still Have Issues

If you still encounter issues after running the fix:

1. Check the Supabase database console to verify the table structure
2. Look for any error messages in the server logs
3. Try running `npm run check-schema` again to see if there are still schema issues
4. You might need to restart the application

## Technical Details

For developers who want to understand more about the fix:

- We've ensured consistent naming in API endpoints (`src/app/api/youtube-notes/route.ts` and `src/app/api/process-youtube/route.ts`)
- We've created diagnostic tools (`check-schema.js` and `refresh-schema-cache.js`)
- We've standardized on camelCase with quotes in the schema definition
- We've added better error handling with detailed logging
